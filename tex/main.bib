abstract = {Motivated by the current high interest in the field of warm dense matter research, in this article we review the uniform electron gas (UEG) at finite temperature and over a broad density range relevant for warm dense matter applications. We provide an exhaustive overview of different simulation techniques, focusing on recent developments in the dielectric formalism (linear response theory) and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. Our primary focus is on two novel QMC methods that have recently allowed us to achieve breakthroughs in the thermodynamics of the warm dense electron gas: Permutation blocking path integral MC (PB-PIMC) and configuration path integral MC (CPIMC). In fact, a combination of PB-PIMC and CPIMC has allowed for a highly accurate description of the warm dense UEG over a broad density–temperature range. We are able to effectively avoid the notorious fermion sign problem, without invoking uncontrolled approximations such as the fixed node approximation. Furthermore, a new finite-size correction scheme is presented that makes it possible to treat the UEG in the thermodynamic limit without loss of accuracy. In addition, we in detail discuss the construction of a parametrization of the exchange–correlation free energy, on the basis of these data — the central thermodynamic quantity that provides a complete description of the UEG and is of crucial importance as input for the simulation of real warm dense matter applications, e.g., via thermal density functional theory. A second major aspect of this review is the use of our ab initio simulation results to test previous theories, including restricted PIMC, finite-temperature Green functions, the classical mapping by Perrot and Dharma-wardana, and various dielectric methods such as the random phase approximation, or the Singwi–Tosi–Land–Sjölander (both in the static and quantum versions), Vashishta–Singwi and the recent Tanaka scheme for the local field correction. Thus, for the first time, thorough benchmarks of the accuracy of important approximation schemes regarding various quantities such as different energies, in particular the exchange–correlation free energy, and the static structure factor, are possible. In the final part of this paper, we outline a way how to rigorously extend our QMC studies to the inhomogeneous electron gas. We present first ab initio data for the static density response and for the static local field correction.}

abstract = {Material equation-of-state (EOS) models, generally providing the pressure and internal energy for a given density and temperature, are required to close the equations of hydrodynamics. As a result they are an essential piece of physics used to simulate inertial confinement fusion (ICF) implosions. Historically, EOS models based on different physical/chemical pictures of matter have been developed for ICF relevant materials such as the deuterium (D2) or deuterium-tritium (DT) fuel, as well as candidate ablator materials such as polystyrene (CH), glow-discharge polymer (GDP), beryllium (Be), carbon (C), and boron carbide (B4C). The accuracy of these EOS models can directly affect the reliability of ICF target design and understanding, as shock timing and material compressibility are essentially determined by what EOS models are used in ICF simulations. Systematic comparisons of current EOS models, benchmarking with experiments, not only help us to understand what the model differences are and why they occur, but also to identify the state-of-the-art EOS models for ICF target designers to use. For this purpose, the first Equation-of-State Workshop, supported by the US Department of Energy’s ICF program, was held at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics (LLE), University of Rochester on 31 May–2nd June, 2017. This paper presents a detailed review on the findings from this workshop: (1) 5–10\% model-model variations exist throughout the relevant parameter space, and can be much larger in regions where ionization and dissociation are occurring, (2) the D2 EOS is particularly uncertain, with no single model able to match the available experimental data, and this drives similar uncertainties in the CH EOS, and (3) new experimental capabilities such as Hugoniot measurements around 100 Mbar and high-quality temperature measurements are essential to reducing EOS uncertainty.}

  abstract = {The experimental investigation of matter under extreme densities and temperatures, as in astrophysical objects and nuclear fusion applications, constitutes one of the most active frontiers at the interface of material science, plasma physics, and engineering. The central obstacle is given by the rigorous interpretation of the experimental results, as even the diagnosis of basic parameters like the temperature T is rendered difficult at these extreme conditions. Here, we present a simple, approximation-free method to extract the temperature of arbitrarily complex materials in thermal equilibrium from X-ray Thomson scattering experiments, without the need for any simulations or an explicit deconvolution. Our paradigm can be readily implemented at modern facilities and corresponding experiments will have a profound impact on our understanding of warm dense matter and beyond, and open up a variety of appealing possibilities in the context of thermonuclear fusion, laboratory astrophysics, and related disciplines.},

abstractNote = {This paper details aspects of the three-component, Helmholtz free energy, equation of state (EOS) model that serves as the construction basis for the majority of the tabular equations of state residing in the SESAME database. The three components account for contributions to the total free energy from the cold curve (or zero Kelvin isotherm), the nuclear vibrational excitations, and the thermal electronic excitations. Decomposition of the model into these three components is a consequence of the underlying theoretical framework describing materials in the condensed matter phase since each of the free energy components directly correspond to a term in the condensed matter system Hamiltonian. In addition to providing an introduction to the theoretical basis of the three-component model and an account of the empirical data utilized to construct an EOS, the aim of this paper is to enable readers to evaluate the applicability of a particular EOS within the context of a problem they are solving by reviewing the thermodynamic phase space in which it has been appropriately constrained. This paper does not aim to serve as an exhaustive documentation of the various methods used in construction of the SESAME tables. Instead, it focuses on the models used during the construction of a particular EOS for aluminum performed by Sjostrom et al. [SCR16] as an illustrative example.},

The demonstration of ignition and energy gain from thermonuclear fuels in the laboratory has been a major goal of fusion research for decades. Thermonuclear ignition is widely considered a milestone in the development of fusion energy, as well as a major scientific achievement with important applications in national security and basic sciences. The US is arguably the world leader in the inertial confinement approach to fusion and has invested in large facilities to pursue it, with the objective of establishing the science related to the safety and reliability of the stockpile of nuclear weapons. Although significant progress has been made in recent years, major challenges still remain in the quest for thermonuclear ignition via laser fusion. Here, we review the current state of the art in inertial confinement fusion research and describe the underlying physical principles.},

ABSTRACT = {European XFEL is a free-electron laser (FEL) user facility providing soft and hard X-ray FEL radiation to initially six scientific instruments. Starting user operation in fall 2017 European XFEL will provide new research opportunities to users from science domains as diverse as physics, chemistry, geo- and planetary sciences, materials sciences or biology. The unique feature of European XFEL is the provision of high average brilliance in the soft and hard X-ray regime, combined with the pulse properties of FEL radiation of extreme peak intensities, femtosecond pulse duration and high degree of coherence. The high average brilliance is achieved through acceleration of up to 27,000 electron bunches per second by the super-conducting electron accelerator. Enabling the usage of this high average brilliance in user experiments is one of the major instrumentation drivers for European XFEL. The radiation generated by three FEL sources is distributed via long beam transport systems to the experiment hall where the scientific instruments are located side-by-side. The X-ray beam transport systems have been optimized to maintain the unique features of the FEL radiation which will be monitored using build-in photon diagnostics. The six scientific instruments are optimized for specific applications using soft or hard X-ray techniques and include integrated lasers, dedicated sample environment, large area high frame rate detector(s) and computing systems capable of processing large quantities of data.},

    abstract = { Kohn–Sham density functional theory has become the leading electronic structure method for atoms, molecules, and extended systems. It is in principle exact, but any practical application must rely on density functional approximations (DFAs) for the exchange-correlation energy. Here we emphasize four aspects of the subject: (a) philosophies and strategies for developing DFAs; (b) classification of DFAs; (c) major sources of error in existing DFAs; and (d) some recent developments and future directions. }

abstract="In the beginning of quantum mechanical Density-Functional Theory (DFT), there was the Thomas-Fermi (TF) model, which uses the electron density p(r) (a function of only 3 coordinates) as the only physical variable. Calculations with this model were inexpensive but yielded poor numerical results due to a lack of understanding of exchange-correlation effects and the kinetic-energy density functional. Many years later, Hohenberg and Kohn (HK) established the formal foundation for DFT; Kohn and Sham (KS) devised a practical implementation and brought DFT into mainstream calculations of electronic structure. Although the KS formulation allows exact evaluation of the KS kinetic energy (Ts [p]), the one-electron orbitals introduced by the KS scheme inevitably encumber the formulation in three ways: (i) 3N (vs. 3) degrees of freedom, (ii) orbital orthonormalization, and (iii) Brillouin-zone (k-point) sampling in condensed phases. Given the accuracy of DFT with present exchange-correlation density functionals, it is logical to conclude that the last frontier in DFT is a better representation of the kinetic energy solely in terms of the density. If this is true, KS orbitals will be completely eliminated from DFT formulation, and the density can be solved directly from the TF-HK equation. This is certainly superior to the KS scheme because all energy terms can be computed in momentum space with an effectively linear scaling, O(MlnM), where M is the integration grid size. This work reviews major ideas in the design of such optimal orbital-free kinetic-energy density functionals and their applications.",

One is the choice between all-electron and pseudopotential calculations and, if the latter, construction of the pseudopotential. Another is the stability, speed, and accuracy of solution algorithms. Underlying both is the fundamental issue of satisfactory quality of the approximate functionals (kinetic energy and exchange–correlation). We address both computational issues and illustrate them by some comparative performance testing of our recently developed modified-conjoint generalized gradient approximation kinetic energy functionals. Comparisons are given for atoms, diatomic molecules, and some simple solids.}

abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses several techniques and addresses several questions concerning the continuous evolution of bound eigenstates into free states under the influence of increasing pressure. As bound states move into the continuum, they evolve into low-energy scattering resonances; these shape resonances occur only at high densities where there is strong screening of the atomic potential. Electrons which occupy resonance states are neither strictly localized nor totally free. For short times the resonance electrons are trapped by the centrifugal barrier; over longer times they escape to large distance. Pressure ionization, resonances, and the continuity principle are linked because the scattering resonances interpolate smoothly between localized bound states and freely moving continuum states. Many plasma properties, including equations of state, electrical conductivity, bremsstrahlung emission, and x-ray opacities are strongly affected by resonances. Even the meaning of the plasma ionization state is clarified by understanding the physical character of resonance states. The continuity theorem implies that there is no discontinuous boundary between low- and high-density behaviors.}

abstract = {A model of dense plasmas relying on the superconfiguration approximation is presented. In each superconfiguration the nucleus is totally screened by the electrons in a Wigner–Seitz sphere (ion–sphere model). Superconfigurations of the same charge are grouped into ions. It is shown that boundary values of the wavefunctions play a crucial role in the form of the Virial theorem from which the pressure formula is derived. Finally, a condition is presented and discussed which makes the ion–sphere model variational when bound electrons are treated quantum mechanically and free electrons quasiclassically.}

Currently we include around 400 functionals for the exchange, correlation, and the kinetic energy, spanning more than 50 years of research. Moreover, libxc is by now used by more than 20 codes, not only from the atomic, molecular, and solid-state physics, but also from the quantum chemistry communities.}

If the activation function is continuous, bounded and nonconstant, then continuous mappings can be learned uniformly over compact input sets. We also give very general conditions ensuring that networks with sufficiently smooth activation functions are capable of arbitrarily accurate approximation to a function and its derivatives.}

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5\% and 17.0\%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3\%, compared to 26.2\% achieved by the second-best entry.},

DL allows analysis of unstructured data and automated identification of features. The recent development of large materials databases has fueled the application of DL methods in atomistic prediction in particular. In contrast, advances in image and spectral data have largely leveraged synthetic data enabled by high-quality forward models as well as by generative unsupervised DL methods. In this article, we present a high-level overview of deep learning methods followed by a detailed discussion of recent developments of deep learning in atomistic simulation, materials imaging, spectral analysis, and natural language processing. For each modality we discuss applications involving both theoretical and experimental data, typical modeling approaches with their strengths and limitations, and relevant publicly available software and datasets. We conclude the review with a discussion of recent cross-cutting work related to uncertainty quantification in this field and a brief perspective on limitations, challenges, and potential growth areas for DL methods in materials science.},

The temperature measures the “nighness” of an electron pair, thus playing a key role in quantitative (exchange and kinetic energy functionals) and qualitative (electron localization functions) tools based on the electron pair density. Two different derivations are given of the Gaussian model for the phase-space distribution function, from which one obtains an approximation to the entropy of the charge distribution.

Generative models based on deep learning are common, but GANs are among the most successful generative models (especially in terms of their ability to generate realistic high-resolution images). GANs have been successfully applied to a wide variety of tasks (mostly in research settings) but continue to present unique challenges and research opportunities because they are based on game theory while most other approaches to generative modeling are based on optimization.},

In particular, significant systematic errors are observed for charge densities involving mobile charges and spins. Kirkpatrick et al. developed a framework to train a deep neural network on accurate chemical data and fractional electron constraints (see the Perspective by Perdew). The resulting functional outperforms traditional functionals on thorough benchmarks for main-group atoms and molecules. The present work offers a solution to a long-standing critical problem in DFT and demonstrates the success of combining DFT with the modern machine-learning methodology. —YS Deep learning solves a long-standing critical limitation of density functional theory in describing fractional charges and spins. Density functional theory describes matter at the quantum level, but all popular approximations suffer from systematic errors that arise from the violation of mathematical properties of the exact functional. We overcame this fundamental limitation by training a neural network on molecular data and on fictitious systems with fractional charge and spin. The resulting functional, DM21 (DeepMind 21), correctly describes typical examples of artificial charge delocalization and strong correlation and performs better than traditional functionals on thorough benchmarks for main-group atoms and molecules. DM21 accurately models complex systems such as hydrogen chains, charged DNA base pairs, and diradical transition states. More crucially for the field, because our methodology relies on data and constraints, which are continually improving, it represents a viable pathway toward the exact universal functional.}}

  abstract = {Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) is a standard tool in most branches of chemistry, but accuracies for many molecules are limited to 2-3 kcal ⋅ mol−1 with presently-available functionals. Ab initio methods, such as coupled-cluster, routinely produce much higher accuracy, but computational costs limit their application to small molecules. In this paper, we leverage machine learning to calculate coupled-cluster energies from DFT densities, reaching quantum chemical accuracy (errors below 1 kcal ⋅ mol−1) on test data. Moreover, density-based Δ-learning (learning only the correction to a standard DFT calculation, termed Δ-DFT ) significantly reduces the amount of training data required, particularly when molecular symmetries are included. The robustness of Δ-DFT  is highlighted by correcting “on the fly” DFT-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of resorcinol (C6H4(OH)2) to obtain MD trajectories with coupled-cluster accuracy. We conclude, therefore, that Δ-DFT  facilitates running gas-phase MD simulations with quantum chemical accuracy, even for strained geometries and conformer changes where standard DFT fails.},

abstract = {Elucidating the behavior of quantum interacting systems of many particles remains one of the biggest challenges in physics. Traditional numerical methods often work well, but some of the most interesting problems leave them stumped. Carleo and Troyer harnessed the power of machine learning to develop a variational approach to the quantum many-body problem (see the Perspective by Hush). The method performed at least as well as state-of-the-art approaches, setting a benchmark for a prototypical two-dimensional problem. With further development, it may well prove a valuable piece in the quantum toolbox. Science, this issue p. 602; see also p. 580 A machine-learning approach sets a computational benchmark for a prototypical two-dimensional problem. The challenge posed by the many-body problem in quantum physics originates from the difficulty of describing the nontrivial correlations encoded in the exponential complexity of the many-body wave function. Here we demonstrate that systematic machine learning of the wave function can reduce this complexity to a tractable computational form for some notable cases of physical interest. We introduce a variational representation of quantum states based on artificial neural networks with a variable number of hidden neurons. A reinforcement-learning scheme we demonstrate is capable of both finding the ground state and describing the unitary time evolution of complex interacting quantum systems. Our approach achieves high accuracy in describing prototypical interacting spins models in one and two dimensions.}}

  abstract = {White dwarfs represent the final state of evolution for most stars1–3. Certain classes of white dwarfs pulsate4,5, leading to observable brightness variations, and analysis of these variations with theoretical stellar models probes their internal structure. Modelling of these pulsating stars provides stringent tests of white dwarf models and a detailed picture of the outcome of the late stages of stellar evolution6. However, the high-energy-density states that exist in white dwarfs are extremely difficult to reach and to measure in the laboratory, so theoretical predictions are largely untested at these conditions. Here we report measurements of the relationship between pressure and density along the principal shock Hugoniot (equations describing the state of the sample material before and after the passage of the shock derived from conservation laws) of hydrocarbon to within five per cent. The observed maximum compressibility is consistent with theoretical models that include detailed electronic structure. This is relevant for the equation of state of matter at pressures ranging from 100 million to 450 million atmospheres, where the understanding of white dwarf physics is sensitive to the equation of state and where models differ considerably. The measurements test these equation-of-state relations that are used in the modelling of white dwarfs and inertial confinement fusion experiments7,8, and we predict an increase in compressibility due to ionization of the inner-core orbitals of carbon. We also find that a detailed treatment of the electronic structure and the electron degeneracy pressure is required to capture the measured shape of the pressure–density evolution for hydrocarbon before peak compression. Our results illuminate the equation of state of the white dwarf envelope (the region surrounding the stellar core that contains partially ionized and partially degenerate non-ideal plasmas), which is a weak link in the constitutive physics informing the structure and evolution of white dwarf stars9.}

To date, the iron phase diagram at high pressure has been investigated experimentally through both laser-heated diamond-anvil cell and shock-compression techniques, as well as through theoretical calculations4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. Despite these contributions, a consensus on the melt line or the high-pressure, high-temperature phase of iron is lacking. Here we report new and re-analysed sound velocity measurements of shock-compressed iron at Earth-core conditions15. We show that melting starts at 225 ± 3 GPa (5,100 ± 500 K) and is complete at 260 ± 3 GPa (6,100 ± 500 K), both on the Hugoniot curve—the locus of shock-compressed states. This new melting pressure is lower than previously reported16, and we find no evidence for a previously reported solid–solid phase transition on the Hugoniot curve near 200 GPa (ref. 16).}

The first order fragment approach does not contain data or parameters that are fitted to the final outcome of the molecular orbital-free calculation and thus represents a parameter-free implementation of orbital-free density functional theory, although it requires the precalculation of atomic data. Consequently, the proposed method is not limited to a specific type of molecule or chemical bonding. The different approximation levels arise from including (first order) or neglecting (zeroth order) the dependency between the potential and the electron density, which in the bifunctional approach are formally treated as independent variables.}",

abstract = {Abstract An approximate expression for the Pauli kinetic energy functional Tp is advanced in terms of the Liu-Parr expansion [S. Liu, R.G. Parr, Phys. Rev. A 1997, 55, 1792] which involves a power series of the one-electron density. We use this explicit functional for Tp to compute the value of the noninteracting kinetic energy functional Ts of 34 atoms, from Li to Kr (and their positive and negative monoions). In particular, we examine the effect that a shell-by-shell mean-square optimization of the expansion coefficients has on the kinetic energy values and explore the effect that the size of the expansion, given by the parameter n, has on the accuracy of the approximation. The results yield a mean absolute percent error for 34 neutral atoms of 0.15, 0.08, 0.04, 0.03, and 0.01 for expansions with n = 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, respectively (where ). We show that these results, which are the most accurate ones obtained to date for the representation of the noninteracting kinetic energy functional, stem from the imposition of shell-inducing traits. We also compare these Liu-Parr functionals with the exact but nonexplicit functional generated in the local-scaling transformation version of DFT.},

abstract = {The last few years have seen significant progress in constructing the atomic models required for non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) simulations. Along with this has come an increased understanding of the requirements for accurately modeling the ionization balance, energy content and radiative properties of different atomic species for a wide range of densities and temperatures. Much of this progress is the result of a series of workshops dedicated to comparing the results from different codes and computational approaches applied to a series of test problems. The results of these workshops emphasized the importance of atomic model completeness, especially in doubly-excited states and autoionization transitions, to calculating ionization balance, and the importance of accurate, detailed atomic data to producing reliable spectra. We describe a simple screened-hydrogenic model that calculates NLTE ionization balance with sufficient accuracy, at a low enough computational cost for routine use in radiation-hydrodynamics codes. The model incorporates term splitting, Δn=0 transitions, and approximate UTA widths for spectral calculations, with results comparable to those of much more detailed codes. Simulations done with this model have been increasingly successful at matching experimental data for laser-driven systems and hohlraums. Accurate and efficient atomic models are just one requirement for integrated NLTE simulations. Coupling the atomic kinetics to hydrodynamics and radiation transport constrains both discretizations and algorithms to retain energy conservation, accuracy and stability. In particular, the strong coupling between radiation and populations can require either very short time steps or significantly modified radiation transport algorithms to account for NLTE material response. Considerations such as these continue to provide challenges for NLTE simulations.}

abstract = {A goal across many physics and engineering disciplines is to use radiation-hydrodynamics codes to accurately simulate systems that are expected to deviate from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), such as laser-driven hohlraums, stellar coronae, and supernova ejecta. The computational expense of traditional non-LTE (NLTE) opacity calculations can dominate the cost of simulating these systems and render NLTE physics untenable in most cases. We present a new parallel implementation for NLTE opacity calculations that employs advanced load balancing, vectorization, and memory management to significantly reduce the computational costs of these calculations. Using the radiation-hydrodynamics code xRAGE, we demonstrate this new implementation on three test problems and present order-of-magnitude speed improvements.}
